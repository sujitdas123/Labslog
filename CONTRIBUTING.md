# Contributing to Lab Management System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lab-management-system.git
   cd lab-management-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in your environment variables
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
